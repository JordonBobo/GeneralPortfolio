# GeneralPortfolio  

This is my current Webpage. Eventually I would like to host it myself 
on my own server along with my other projects and webpages.

The design is basic but I might expand the CSS later. The page works 
as a hub for my current and best projects. It has links to several other 
pages and projects hosted on GitHub. It also has contact info for reaching 
out to me.
